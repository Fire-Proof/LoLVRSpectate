## Requirements 
* a HTC Vive or another VR headset that support for the [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) SDK
* VorpX or another program to project League of Legends onto the HMD

#### Optional
* 1 or 2 Motion controllers that support for the [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) SDK

## Installation
1. Install python3
2. Install the python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

or wait for me to build a executable. (soonâ„¢) 

## Running 
1. Make sure VorpX is running
2. Make sure the VR environment is active, ie. start SteamVR
3. Start spectating a game or a replay
4. When the game is fully loaded, start the program by running `python run.py`

## Controls
#### Camera
##### Without controllers 
Walk around and admire the landscape
##### With 1 controller
Hold down the trigger and move the controller to readjust the view along the x, y and z axis
##### With 2 controllers 
Hold down one trigger to readjust the view along the x and y axis
Hold down both triggers and "pinch" to zoom and rotate the controllers in relation to each other to rotate the camera

## Recommended settings
These settings are probably far from perfect, buts its the ones i use for testing
#### League of Legends
Reduce the resolution to a lower value, i use 1280x1024
#### VorpX
Enable these two settings in the settings dialog

In the ingame settings menu set image zoom to 0.70 and and set the head tracking sensetivity to 0.0 to avoid it moving the cursor
